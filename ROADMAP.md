# project roadmap

here is the ideal plan of things I want to get done with the project before really marketing this bot as a solution.

## revving up

### alpha release -> August 2017

- [x] get bittrex all coins
- [x] check social for the symbol
- [x] score the coin based on text sentiment analysis
- [x] telegram it
- [x] ensure it is even working :joy:
- [x] give out link to a few groups: https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEKhK3X1ngRfVa_NWA

### beta release -> September 2017

- [x] [cleanup scoring methods for twitter](https://github.com/awitherow/moonbot/issues/16)
- [x] [ensure scoring is time aware](https://github.com/awitherow/moonbot/issues/13)
- [twitter longer trends](https://github.com/awitherow/moonbot/issues/15)
- [dandelion.eu sentiment analysis](https://github.com/awitherow/moonbot/issues/5)
- [record all market data for coin analysis](https://github.com/awitherow/moonbot/issues/6)

### cleanup -> October 2017

This phase will be focused on a lot of testing to ensure functions are working as expected, as well as ensuring that upstream system failures do not crash the application. WIP on the todo list
